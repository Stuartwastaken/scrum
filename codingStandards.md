## Function and Class Names
- Functions and class names should follow a **camelCase** format.
- Examples include: `customTextField()`, `dispose()`, `gamePin()`

## File Names
- File names that the user will visually see (screens) should follow a format with a `-` separating each word in the file.
- Examples include: `login-screen.dart`, `register-screen.dart`, `make-quiz-screen.dart`.

## On the Subject of Overall Format
- Maintain the general Flutter layout formatting
